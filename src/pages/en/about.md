My name is Vinicius Dacal Lopes, I am 22 years old and I am Bachelor of Technology in Internet Systems.

I make websites for fun since I was 14, when I took a course in web design.

When I was 18, I started working in a digital agency called [ADN MÃºltipla](http://adnmultipla.com), where I used to work with websites and mobile apps. I worked mainly with Front End development but also with Back End and some programming languages like JAVA and Objective C.

Currently I'm working as Front End Developer in a very cool company called [Coderockr](http://coderockr.com). I have been working with interesting technologies like AngularJS and RESTful APIs.

I made some experiments like [Pure CSS3 Bender Futurama](https://github.com/viniciusdacal/bender-css3) and [Pure CSS3 Iron Man Marvel](https://github.com/viniciusdacal/ironman).

I treat every difficulty as a challenge, it makes everything easier and fun.

I believe I have a lot to learn and I think this is the best of life, always have something to learn and something to perfecting.
